## 🌟 Highlights

- 🔍 **In-depth Analysis** of the movie dataset for patterns and insights  
- 🧩 **Content Similarity Model** using TF‑IDF vectors on genres, descriptions, cast, etc.  
- 🧠 **Trained ML Pipeline** stored via Pickle for fast loading  
- 💻 **Interactive Front-End** built using Streamlit or Flask  
- 🚀 **Deployment-Ready** structure for easy hosting on cloud platforms

## 🧠 Core Logic

This recommendation engine relies on **content similarity**.  
When a user selects a movie, the system identifies other movies that share similar attributes such as:

- Genre combinations  
- Plot keywords  
- Actors and directors  
- Descriptive metadata  

The model computes similarity scores and returns the closest matches.
